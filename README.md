# OpenID Connect Enterprise Connection Integration Template

This template is used to create a guide instruction customers on how to create and configure an OpenID Connect Enterprise Connection that allow users to login with an external identity provider.

## Getting started

Follow the instructions in the [Connect to OpenID Connect Identity Provider](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers/enterprise-identity-providers/oidc) documentation to build and test an OpenID Connect Connection using your service.

In the `integration` folder you'll find an `installation_guide.md` file. This is the Markdown-formatted instructions that tenant admins will use to install and configure your Action. This file has a number of `TODO` items that indicate what needs to be added. Your guide should retain the same format and general Auth0 installation steps.

## Submit for review

When your integration has been written and tested, it's time to submit it for review.

1. Replace the `media/256x256-logo.png` file with an image of the same size and format (256 pixel square on a transparent background)
1. If you provided value-proposition columns and would like to include images, replace the `media/460x260-column-*.png` files with images of the same size and format; otherwise, delete these images before submitting
1. Run `make zip` in the root of the integration package and upload the resulting archive to the Jira ticket.

If you have any questions or problems with this, please reply back on the support ticket!

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional [username/password databases](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/database/custom-db).
* Add support for [linking different user accounts](https://auth0.com/docs/link-accounts) with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when, and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules/current).
